	Abstract = {The travelling tournament problem (TTP) was introduced as a challenging sports timetabling problem (Easton et al., 2001). Its objective is to minimise the total distance travelled in a double round robin tournament. A solution must satisfy the following constraints: home and away games between two teams should not be scheduled on consecutive game days, and teams should not play more than three consecutive home/away games. Test data and results are presented on the TTP website4. In this abstract, we present the results of a metaheuristic approach for the NL instances of the TTP website. The algorithm consists of a constructive and an improvement heuristic. Many examples of successful constructive heuristics have been reported, including; 1 Factorization (Di Gaspero and Schaerf, 2007); the Polygon Method (Biajoli and Lorena, 2006), (Ribeiro and Urrutia, 2004) and Tiling (Bar-Noy and Moody, 2006), (Kendall et al., 2006). The first phase of the metaheuristic builds upon the tiling approach of (Kendall et al., 2006), as it explicitly addresses the problem of minimising the travelling distance. It assigns as many tiles as possible to an initially empty schedule, after which a metaheuristic algorithm turns the schedule into a feasible solution.},

	Abstract = {The travelling tournament problem is a challenging sports timetabling problem which is widely believed to be NP-hard. The objective is to establish a feasible double round robin tournament schedule, with minimum travel distances. This paper investigates the application of an ant based hyper-heuristic algorithm for this problem. Ant algorithms, a well known meta-heuristic, have been successfully applied to various problems. Whilst hyper-heuristics are an emerging technology, which operate at a higher level of abstraction than meta-heuristics. This paper presents a framework which employs ant algorithms as a hyper-heuristic. We show that this approach produces good quality solutions for the traveling tournament problem when compared with results from the literature},
