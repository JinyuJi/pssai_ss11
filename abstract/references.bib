abstract = {The travelling tournament problem (TTP) was introduced as a challenging sports timetabling problem (Easton et al., 2001). Its objective is to minimise the total distance travelled in a double round robin tournament. A solution must satisfy the following constraints: home and away games between two teams should not be scheduled on consecutive game days, and teams should not play more than three consecutive home/away games. Test data and results are presented on the TTP website4. In this abstract, we present the results of a metaheuristic approach for the NL instances of the TTP website. The algorithm consists of a constructive and an improvement heuristic. Many examples of successful constructive heuristics have been reported, including; 1 Factorization (Di Gaspero and Schaerf, 2007); the Polygon Method (Biajoli and Lorena, 2006), (Ribeiro and Urrutia, 2004) and Tiling (Bar-Noy and Moody, 2006), (Kendall et al., 2006). The first phase of the metaheuristic builds upon the tiling approach of (Kendall et al., 2006), as it explicitly addresses the problem of minimising the travelling distance. It assigns as many tiles as possible to an initially empty schedule, after which a metaheuristic algorithm turns the schedule into a feasible solution.},
